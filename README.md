Factions
====================
This fork of [MassiveCraft Factions](https://github.com/MassiveCraft/Factions) was created to address changes in the competitive factions community that have been privately added on several factions servers but not seen publically. 

Changes from default [Factions](https://github.com/MassiveCraft/Factions):

 * Coleader rank
 * Trusted permission (Disallows breaking / placing of certain blocks you choose)
 * Sister factions
 * Fly (No command to enable flight status or whatever, it is automatic)
 * Radius in which an enemy will disable flight
 * Instantbreak sponges
 * Increased f map size
 * Various text changes
 * /coleader
 * /member
 * /recruit
