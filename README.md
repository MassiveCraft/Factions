Factions - Guilding and user-controlled antigrief plugin for Minecraft
====================
This plugin will allow the players on the server to create factions/guilds. The factions can claim territory that will be protected from non-members. Factions can forge alliances and declare themselves enemies with others. Land may be taken from other factions through war.

The goals of this plugin:

 * The players should be able to take care of anti-griefing themselves.
 * Inspire politics and intrigues on your server.
 * Guilding and team spirit! :)

Usage
