# Debug
# Turn this on if you are having issues with something and working on resolving them.
# This will spam your console with information that is useful if you know how to read the source.
# It's suggested that you only turn this on at the direction of a developer.
debug: false

# Prevent find factions exploit
# This will help limit how many times a player can be sent a map of factions.
# Set this to the cooldown you want, in miliseconds, for a map to be shown to a player.
# If you want to log when a player violates this (only happens on chunk enter so it shouldn't be too spammy),
#   set log to true and it will be logged to console as "player tried to show a faction map too soon and triggered exploit blocker."
findfactionsexploit:
  cooldown: 2000 # in miliseconds. 2000 = 2 seconds.

# Configuration section for Scoreboards
# This will allow you to completely customize how your scoreboards look.
# Make sure that no lines are duplicates of each other otherwise only the first will display.
# Use &0-9a-f for colors and include messages in "quotes"
scoreboard:

# How long do we want scoreboards to stay if set temporarily.
  expiration: 7

# FInfo scoreboard is displayed when a player walks into a new Faction's territory.
# Scoreboard disappears after <expiration> seconds.
# Things to be replaced in this:
# {power} - faction's power. {chunks} - total claimed chunks. {members} - total members.
# {online} - online members. {leader} - faction's leader. {open} - shows either true or false if open.
# {raidable} - true if the faction can be claimed over, otherwise false.
# The title of the scoreboard will be the Faction's tag and colored according to the relation with the player's Faction.
# Commenting this section out will cause the info to appear in chat as the plugin originally did.
  finfo-enabled: false # Default to false to keep original functionality.
