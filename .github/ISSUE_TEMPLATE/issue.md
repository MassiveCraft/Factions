    as a player. Don't simply put "latest" or we will ignore it.
    
2.  When linking files, do not attach them to the post! Paste them on 
    https://gist.github.com/, then paste a link to them in the relevant parts
    of the template. Avoid using Hastebin or Pastebin, as files are deleted
    after a period of time.

    include screenshots detailing the problem.
